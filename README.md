Complete developer guide and real feedback for deploying smart contracts on Pod Network V1 Devnet - the blockchain with fast transaction finality.
🌐 What is Pod Network?
Pod Network is a Layer 1 blockchain that fundamentally reimagines how blockchains work:
🚫 No Traditional Blocks
Unlike Ethereum's sequential blocks, Pod Network uses streaming consensus where transactions flow directly to validators without global ordering requirements.
⚡ Fast Finality
Transactions typically confirm in under 1 second vs 30+ seconds on Ethereum - significantly faster!
🔄 Coordination-Free Architecture
Applications can run in parallel without waiting for global state coordination, enabling improved scalability.
💰 Cost Effective
Deploy contracts for 99% less than Ethereum mainnet costs.
