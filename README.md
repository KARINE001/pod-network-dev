Complete developer guide and real feedback for deploying smart contracts on **Pod Network V1 Devnet** - the blockchain with **fast transaction finality**.

## 🌐 What is Pod Network?

Pod Network is a **Layer 1 blockchain** that fundamentally reimagines how blockchains work:

### 🚫 **No Traditional Blocks**
Unlike Ethereum's sequential blocks, Pod Network uses **streaming consensus** where transactions flow directly to validators without global ordering requirements.

### ⚡ **Fast Finality** 
Transactions typically confirm in **under 1 second** vs 30+ seconds on Ethereum - that's **much faster**!

### 🔄 **Coordination-Free Architecture**
Applications can run in parallel without waiting for global state coordination, enabling unprecedented scalability.

### 💰 **Cost Effective**
Deploy contracts for **99% less** than Ethereum mainnet costs.
